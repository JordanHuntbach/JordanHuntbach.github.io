I was thinking about what to write in the 'about me' section for this blog, and considered the following sections:
* Things I enjoy
* Things I believe
* Things I think about a lot

However, I realised that what I write there won't be confined to a single blog post with a timestamp, it will stand out 
in its own section until I come back and change it, which I don't expect to do frequently. 
I'll cover those topics in this post instead, so that I can keep that section more general.

## Things I enjoy

### Video Games

I probably could have put this one in the 'about me' section, I have considered myself a 'gamer' for as long as I can
remember.

Some of my favourite games: 
* The Last of Us
* Cyberpunk 2077
* The Witcher 3
* Skyrim
* Ghost of Tsushima
* inFamous
* Minecraft

### Reading

Sci-fi, fantasy, historical fiction.

I'm currently reading The Best of Greg Egan.

Some books I've read recently that I would recommend:
* Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir
* The Science and Technology of Growing Young - Sergey Young
* The Expanse - James S.A. Corey
* Homo Deus - Yuval Noah Harari

Some books on my to-read list:
* Some of Isaac Asimov's work
* American Gods - Neil Gaiman

### Cooking

## Things I believe

Within the next 50 years ASI will have been created, and aging will have been cured. This gives us an almost infinite
amount of time for an almost infinitely intelligent system to advance everything about our lives. This gives rise to 
several other cool beliefs, for instance I will:
* live to be thousands of years old.
* live in a post-scarcity world where AI provides everything that we currently spend money on for little or no cost.
* have the time and the means to visit every country on Earth.
* step foot on another planet, potentially even another solar system.
* fly a space-ship one day.
* have sex in zero-gravity.
* learn a myriad of new skills, including scuba diving, flying a plane, freestyle skiing, wing-suit flying, etc.

## Things I spend a lot of time thinking about

What will society look like in a post-scarcity world? 
Will there still be any hierarchy or class system? 
How will we fill our time?

What is the maximum sustainable population of Earth? 
What about the solar system? 
The galaxy? 
What happens when we hit these limits?

What is the nature of the universe?
Are we living in a simulation? 
If so, who created us? 
Are they living in a simulation?

What is the nature of consciousness?
What are the limits on what humans can do with their mind? 
Is it possible, through meditation, to have full control over one's emotions / mental state?
